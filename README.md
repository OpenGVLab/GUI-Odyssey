## 🔆 Introduction
GUIOdyssey is a comprehensive dataset for training and evaluating **cross-app** navigation agents. GUIOdyssey consists of 8,334 episodes from 6 mobile devices, spanning 6 types of cross-app tasks, 212 apps, and 1.4K app combos.   

For more details, please refer to our [latest paper](assets/GUIOdyssey.pdf).

## 🛠️ Data collection pipeline 
GUIOdyssey comprises six categories of navigation tasks. For each category, we construct instruction templates with items and apps selected from a predefined pool, resulting in a vast array of unique instructions for annotating GUI episodes. Human demonstrations on an Android emulator capture the metadata of each episode in a comprehensive format. After rigorous quality checks, GUIOdyssey includes 8,834 validated cross-app GUI navigation episodes.
